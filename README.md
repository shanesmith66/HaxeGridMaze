This is a bonus exercise for my game programming course. Includes a simple block maze and an automatic solver. Just used some makeshift algorithm in order to solve the maze.
The maze can be solved from any point after moving the blocks.
CONTROLS
Use arrow keys to move block through maze
(Block is blue, exit is green)
Press SPACE to solve the maze at any point.
